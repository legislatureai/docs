**Analysts** are a powerful way to drill down to what matters for your priorities. Each analyst is created by our team for your organization, based on your perspectives and priorities. Analysts read and grade every bill and agenda item in the state at all levels of government: city, county, and the state legislature.

## The Analysts page

To view your analysts, go to the analysts page using the link on the Insights navigation bar at the top left of the page.

## Filtering by analyst recommendations

You can filter by any analyst's recommendations on any of the main pages (the [meetings page](https://legislature.ai/meetings), [bills page](https://legislature.ai/bills), or [news page](https://legislature.ai/news)).

On the left sidebar, find the Analysts filter and click to select an analyst:

Once an analyst is selected, more options will open to drill down further:

Here's how to use these options:

### Drill down based on relevance

Adjust the **Min relevance** filter to include only bills the analyst has rated as a certain percentage relevant to their priorities.

</Frame>

- By default, we set this as bills at least **70% relevant**, as rated by that analyst.
- Narrowing your search all the way down to only bills **95% relevant** will drill down to a small number of bills that are extremely and directly relevant to that analyst's priorities. For example, an 'Artificial Intelligence Analyst' selected and drilled down to 90% relevance might return only bills that directly mention AI and are completely concerned with regulating AI.
- Broadening your search to only bills **10% relevant** will widen the range to a very large number of bills that are only very distantly or tangentially relevant to that analyst's priorities. For example, an 'Artificial Intelligence Analyst' selected with range broadened to 10% minimum relevance might return a wide range of bills relating to technology.

### Drill down based on impact

Adjust the **Min impact** filter to include only bills the analyst has rated as a certain percentage impactful on their priorities, similar to the mininum relevance filter.

By default, we set this at **50% impactful**, as we tend to find a broader default range for impact is useful to encompass all relevant bills.

### Drill down to risks and opportunities

Adjusting the **Min / max positive sentiment** filters will constrain the bills returned to a certain range of analyst sentiment, or how much the analyst likes the bill.

  <img src="/images/sentiment.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

- By default, we show the full range (minimum set to 0% and maximum set to 100%);
- Narrowing the **Min positive sentiment filter to 50%** will drill down only to **opportunities**, or bills that the analyst likes.
- Narrowing the **Max positive sentiment filter to 50%** will drill down only to **risks**, or bills that the analyst dislikes.

The results will drill down to only the bills tagged (or only meetings where those bills are scheduled if you're on the meetings page, or news articles related to those bills if you're on the news page).

The analysts filter can be combined with other filters to drill down further as well.

## Viewing analyst recomendations

To view analyst recommendation, navigate to any recommended bill's page. You can find these bills by visiting the [bills page](https://legislature.ai/bills) and filtering by analyst (see above).

When you are logged in as an Insights user and on a bill page, if there are recommendations on that bill, you will see them in the left-hand column. Sentiment is indicated by the color and percentage shown on the bar. For example, the below screenshot indicates the analyst likes the bill.
